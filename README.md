# Buymart - Exosite Code Challenge
## Prerequisites
1. Yarn (I think you can npm without issue)
2. React
3. react-router-dom: yarn add react-router-dom@4.2.0 or npm install react-router-dom@4.2.0

## How To Run
yarn start
or
npm start

## Design Choices
This was created using the command _npx_ _create_ _react_ _app_, therefore there is some boiler plate code.

I used no outside css frameworks or javascript libraries, just yarn, react, and react-router-dom.  I did this to keep things light and easy to install/run on your end (and it lets me showcase that I know css without outside help.)

## Honest Assessment

As discussed during the phone interview, react is a tool I've used in the past, but never went very in-depth with nor did I keep up to speed on it's evolution since I last used it.  Therefore, I'm sure my project structure is lacking compared to a daily node developer and react user.

Had this been a more in depth project I would have used outside css and javascript libraries to help create a more fluid user experience between mobile and desktop views.  This libraries would have gone hand in hand with database to persist manipulate the data provided in the UI and from the database.  Because of the lack of a database I used a flat file to store product information and saved all user inputs with react props, props.location, and url params throughout the workflow.

I honestly don't know if I used the react router in the intended way.  I come from a rails environment and we use a routes file to declare routes.  I used the browser router in a way that made the application work and made sense to me.

I need more practice breaking up views into smaller components.

I would probably have done the color scheme a bit different.  That's not really an assessment about myself but rather me letting you know that I'd strive for a better ui.  Along those same lines, I also would have added product images, reviews, etc.

## Conclusion

All in all I had a fun time doing this project.  It was fun to brush up on my react skills and I hope it's up to your standard.
